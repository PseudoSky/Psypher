# Ephemeral

Ephemeral is my Information Systems capstone project. It is a cross site message encryption system.
Works on Facebook, Groupme, Slack, Gmail, and I couldn't really think of more to test...
The name Ephemeral comes from (my favorite feature of the application) the ability to interactively specify the duration of short term session keys. This means, like snap chat, the key will disappear after a short period of time and the data can no longer be read... Until the NSA decrypts it...

Works Flawlessly:  Facebook and Slack

Slight Issues: GroupMe (adds b around text) and Gmail  (tweaks out when you enter it in the compose popup)
